# MeteorGame
A ship attempts to bypass a field of asteroids to reach the end boundary.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Java (Eclipse) 

In this project, I crafted a GUI that allows a user/player to navigate a ship through a field of asteroids to reach the end boundary. The GUI displays an error message if the user collides with an asteroid, and a success message if the user successfully navigates to the end boundary. Each element class in my code implements the same Polygon class, which constructs a shape using a series of points. The ship and asteroid classes both implement the Motion class, which allow them to move freely and spin respectively. I also created a source folder for my space image background.

## Lessons Learned:

From this project, I discovered and developed a great variety of new skills. In terms of soft skills developed, I improved upon my problem-solving ability and my critical thinking skills. But in terms of more hard technical skills learned, I discovered how to create GUIs, how to implement the KeyListener interface, and how to implement inner classes, anonymous classes, and lambda expressions.
